\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
In this paper, we propose a novel event extraction paradigm without expert-designed event templates by leveraging structured knowledge bases or tables to automatically acquire event schema and corresponding training data. We propose a BLSTM-CRF model with ILP-based post inference to extract multi-typed event mentions without explicit trigger annotations. Experimental results on both manual and automatic evaluations show that it is possible to learn to identify both typed events and typed roles with indirect supervision from Freebase or Wikipedia tables. 
In the future, we will first further investigate how to better characterize key arguments for a certain event type, and extend our work to update a structured knowledge base according to news events.

%Furthermore, our model can extract information not covered by Freebase which indicates the possibility to extend this work to knowledge base population.
