\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
In this paper, we propose a new event extraction paradigm without expert-designed event templates by leveraging structured knowledge bases to automatically acquire event schema and corresponding training data. We propose an LSTM-CRF model with ILP-based post inference to extract events without explicit trigger annotations. Experimental results on both manual and automatic evaluations show that it is possible to learn to extract KB-style events on automatically constructed training data.
Furthermore, our model can extract information not covered by Freebase which indicates the possibility to extend this work to knowledge base population.
